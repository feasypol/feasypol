We are having discord calls almost every night. Talking about random things, huh. Is she into me too? I mean we are saying good morning every single day i guess that’s a huge sign and im blind. Yesterday we made a fruit tier list and she doesn’t like dragonfruit wtf?? Weirdo?? Well I mean the barney stuff is funny asdjaljsdkl.",
            "We watched bee the movie tonight after i said “ntar malem nobar bee aja gausah ngerjain mtk”. Twas two days ago tho. Im lazy to do the stupid math assignment. After all done, here we are tonight. This is where I feel dumb, when I just recognize that she’s into me like, from when? I waited way too long. Kinda want to make a move first, but we close like this barely a month or so. I remember she was having blushes in English class when we were doing the roleplay together. That should be my “this is it”, HAHAHAHA."

Honestly, quite an irony and funny. Considering how my blogs contain mostly rants and my worries. Might change it again later, but that’s okay I live with it for now.",
            "Name, done. What else? Talk about my interest? Briefly mentioned in my homepage, yes I’m very into community service. I love volunteering in my local area. Because I get to talk and interact with locals here. Although listening to their problems makes me mad about this country more and more, lol. Then there comes my second interest, advocacy. As a student from the political science faculty, this is our regular morning coffee. However, some still overlook marginalized people in their life because things are often taken as granted. I mainly focused on people with disabilities as my concern. In a country that still sees disability as a symptom and needs to be treated medically, advocacy is a way for them to be recognized more as a person. Who has human rights, just like all of us.",
